This C++ program manages a list of employees, each with attributes like name, age, hobbies, and preferred programming language. The `Empleado` struct defines these attributes. The program sorts the list of employees alphabetically by their names using the `sort` function and the `CompararNombres` function. Then, it prompts the user to enter an employee's name to search for. The search is performed using a binary search algorithm, implemented in the `BinarySearch` function. If the employee is found, their details are displayed; otherwise, a message indicating the employee was not found is shown.
